# 5th year MSci project
Investigating possibility of compression of sensor data for ATLAS upgrade

## Documentation

For some info how the code works look at:

 * [event_converter.ipynb](event_converter.ipynb) - notebook that contains helper functions to load 
   modules and events from root tree files,
 * [cluster_sizes.ipynb](cluster_sizes.ipynb) - notebook that contains helper functions to retrieve clusters from a module. 
   Also contains cluster size analysis,
 * [tots.ipynb](tots.ipynb) - notebook that does ToT analysis and some compression comparisons. 
   Code related to compression will be extracted to different notebook in the future.
